# Eat-da-burger  - Homework Assignment  - Week 7

Eat-da-burger is a demonstration of basic mySql database manipulation using the CRUD model. The MVC pattern has been expanded from previous projects with the addition of the handlebars package, which handles the view portion of the MVC. SQl data manipulation is preformed via an ORM, and HTML functionality is provided through express.
